# 3.1 - Boolean Expressions
1. primititive values and reference values can be compared using relational opertors
- ==,!=
2. Arithmetic expression values can be compared using relational operators
- <,>,<=,>=
3. coditional statements interrupt the sequential executuion of statements.
 - 'if' statements affect the flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression.
 4. a two - way selection is written when there sare two sets of statements.
 - one statement is executed when boolean = true
 - the second statement is the 'else' body, which is then executed


 #side note
 true == false results to false
 - this is because java if x = y and they aren't the same so it returns false
