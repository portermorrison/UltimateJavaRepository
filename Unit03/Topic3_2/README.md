# 3.2 - `if` Statements and Control Flow

1. coditional statements interrupt the sequential executuion of statements.
 - 'if' statements affect the flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression.
2. true == false results to false
 - this is because java if x = y and they aren't the same so it returns false
