# Unit 05 - Writing Classes
- Public and private affect the access of classes, data, constructors and methods.
- private restricts access to the declaring class, while public allows access from classes outside the declasring class
## 5.1 - Anatomy of a Class
- Classes and constructors are designated public
- instance variables are designated public
## 5.2 - Constructors
- An object's state refers to its attributes and their values at a given time and is defined by instance variables belonging to the object. This creates a "has-a" relationship between the obect and its instance variables
- Constructors are used to set the initial state of an object, which should include intitial values for all instance variables
## 5.3 - Documentation with Comments
- three types of comments in java: 
- '/* */' which generates a block of comments
- // which generates a comment on one line
- /** */ which are Javadoc comments and are used to create API documantation
## 5.4 - Accessor Methods
- An accessor method allows othr objects to obtain the vlaue of instance variables or static variables. 
- A non- void method returnd a single value . Its header includes the return type in place of the keyword void.
- In non-void methods, a return expression compatible with the return type is evaluated, and a copy of that value is returned. That is referred to as "return by value."
## 5.5 - Mutator Methods
- A void method does not return a value. its header contains the keyword void before the method name. 
- A mutator (modifier) method is often a void method that changes the values of instance variables or static variables.
## 5.6 - Writing Methods
- 
## 5.7 - Static Variables and Methods

## 5.8 - Scope and Access

## 5.9 - `this` Keyword

## 5.10 - Ethical and Social Implications of Computing Systems
