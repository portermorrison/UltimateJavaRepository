# Unit 6 - Array

## 6.1 - Array Creation and Access
- An array is a data structure used to implement a collection (list) of primitive or object reference data.
- An element is a single value in the array.
- The index of an element is the position of the element in the array.
## 6.2 - Traversing Arrays
- iteration statements cab e used to access all the elements in an array, This is called traversing the array.
- means to access each element of an array.
- requires elements to be accessed using their indices
## 6.3 - Enhanced for Loop for Arrays
- An enhanced 'for' loop header includes a variable, referred to as the enhanced 'for' loop variable
- Assigning a new value to the enhanced 'for' loop variable does not change the value stored in the array.
- Program code written using an enhanced 'for' loop to traverse and access elements in an array can be rewritten using an indexed 'for' loop or a 'while' loop.
## 6.4 - Developing Algorithms Using Arrays
- There are standard algorithms that utilize traversals to shift or rotate elements left or right.
