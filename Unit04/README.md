# Unit 4 - Iteration

## 4.1 - `while` Loops
- loop is a repitition of statements
- enter 'while' loop, check boolean expression, if true then execute loop, then repeat. If boolean check ever returns false, the code exits the loop and moves on.
- always true loops become infinite
- 

## 4.2 - `for` Loops
- three parts: the initialization, the boolean expression, and the increment(can also be a decrement statement.)
- both while loops and for loops can be rewritten to an equivalent onf one another

## 4.3 - Developing Algorithms Using Strings
- standard algorithms utilze String traversals to find if onw or more substrings have a particular property

## 4.4 - Nested Iteration
- nested iteration statements are iteration statements that appear in the body od another iteration statement.
- when a loop is nested insided another loop, the inner loop must complete all its iterations before the outer loop can continue
- 

## 4.5 - Informal Code Analysis
- A statement executuion sount idicates the number of times a statement is executed by the program.
