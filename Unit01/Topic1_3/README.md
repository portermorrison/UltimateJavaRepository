# VIDEO ONE

Adition +
Subtraction -
Multiplication *
division /
Modulus % 
    - NOT A PERCENT

int + int = int
- becomes problem with decimals (division especially)
use double + double = double instead
COMBINING? GO WITH BIGGER DATATYPE
double + int = double
(double is a bigger bit) - bit means more options for the code to choose from

IN JAVA
int/int rounds to nearest whole number bc it has to equal int
int % int = exact answer, division but shows remainder

# VIDEO TWO
modulus holds the same presedence as division in math equations
- this means it must be done before addition and subtraction

# Video Three
operator equal sign
variable = value
a = 4
john = happyHumanGuy
evaluates right to left, assigns right to left
