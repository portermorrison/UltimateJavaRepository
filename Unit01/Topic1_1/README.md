# 1.1 Why Programming? Why Java? 


VIDEO ONE: system class methods
1.) output to console (show stuff on screen)
- Block comments: /* and */
- Class must match file name (class refers to the subject in which you're coding)
- System.Out generates output to console
    - system.out.print displays whatever is in the ()
    - system.out.println same as .print but moves to next line after
2.) VIDEO 2: String literals
- a string literals are enclosed within double quotes
- a string literal is an exact sequence of characters that are enclosed between double quotes
- syntax error is when the syntax(comands/prompts) are incorrect, such as a lowercase s in system.out
- logic error is a mistake that affects the output, such as mispelling a string literal (misspelling your sentences, your quotes)
3.) VIDEO 3: identify problems in code, how to fix
- syntax error/compiler error: misspelling prompts and coding
    - highlighted usually
- Logic error: mistakes within string literal
    - 
VIDEO 4: Primitive Date
1.) it determines the size and type of data we can run in a program
- data types: 
    Bolean - True/False
    Int - whole numbers
    doubles or loading point numbers - decimals
    string/text - msg - refer
- primitive data types are pre-known java commands

## Leaving Notes in README.md Files

Leave notes here of things you learn while watching the videos. This file is in Markdown format, which allows you to include **bold** and _italic_ text, as well as lists, links, and images. An information-dense cheatsheet for Markdown can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Trying Out Code in Main.java Files

The `Main.java` files in each folder are meant to be used to try out the code you see in the videos, to experiment with your own code, and to explore the code referenced in the assigned questions. 

There should be a "Run" button at the top of the editor window that will compile and run the code in the `Main.java` file. I also encourage you to occasionally compile and run the code from the command line as this offers additional flexible ways of running the code (more details later). If your terminal is at the base directory (`UltimateJavaRepository`), you can compile and run the files like so:

```
javac Unit01/Topic1_1/Main.java
java Unit01.Topic1_1.Main
```

Sorry about the more complicated syntax for running the code from the command line; it's a necessary Java thing if you're going to keep your code organized in a big repository like this.
