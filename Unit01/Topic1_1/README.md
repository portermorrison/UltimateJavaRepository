# 1.1 Why Programming? Why Java? 


VIDEO ONE: system class methods
1.) output to console (show stuff on screen)
- Block comments: /* and */
- Class must match file name (class refers to the subject in which you're coding)
- System.Out generates output to console
    - system.out.print displays whatever is in the ()
    - system.out.println same as .print but moves to next line after
2.) VIDEO 2: String literals
- a string literals are enclosed within double quotes
- a string literal is an exact sequence of characters that are enclosed between double quotes
- syntax error is when the syntax(comands/prompts) are incorrect, such as a lowercase s in system.out
- logic error is a mistake that affects the output, such as mispelling a string literal (misspelling your sentences, your quotes)
3.) VIDEO 3: identify problems in code, how to fix
- syntax error/compiler error: misspelling prompts and coding
    - highlighted usually
- Logic error: mistakes within string literal
